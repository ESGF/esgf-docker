The ESGF Docker project aims to provide [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/)
for each of the components of the [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) software stack,
as an alternative to the traditional installer.

These components can then be deployed in a single-node configuration using
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), or in a cluster using
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

This site provides documentation for using the ESGF Docker containers.
